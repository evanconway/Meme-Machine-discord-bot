# Meme-Machine-discord-bot

This is a python rewrite of the bot. Right now starting the bot is saved as a command. To start the bot navigate to the directory with `manage.py` and run:

`python manage.py runbot`

To start the django server navigate to the same directory and run:

`python manage.py runserver`

Ensure that `.env` files in all directories containing examples are correctly filled out before running commands.
