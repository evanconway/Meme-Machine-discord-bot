# Meme-Machine-discord-bot

A discord bot designed to make hanging out with friends more fun!

## Features

### Beetlejuice Reference
Type one of these words three times to ping everyone on the server: boys, bois, boyz, guys, guyz, bros, broz.

### Upvote With Message
Send a message containing only the ^caret symbol to place an up arrow reaction on the previous message. Your ^caret message will be automatically deleted.

### Programmable Responses
The discord bot can be programmed to respond certain ways whenever a user types certain messages. To program the bot, send a message with the following syntax:

`Hey bot! When I say "call" you say "response"`

Whenever any user on the server says the "call", the bot will automatically send a message containing the "response". This is useful for images because discord will automatically display image urls as the image itself. Perfect for getting the bot to display a meme or funny picture based on certain messages.
